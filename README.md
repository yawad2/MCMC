# MCMC

## Project Overview

This project involves implementing Gibbs sampling for Markov Random Fields. It includes deriving the proposal distribution, comparing the accuracy of Gibbs sampling with exact calculations using Mean Squared Error (MSE), and analyzing performance across different step counts. The results and detailed analysis are documented in the accompanying report.
